 .BI \-b\  backlog
 Set max number of outstanding audit buffers allowed (Kernel Default=64) If all buffers are full, the failure flag is consulted by the kernel for action.

-Set the time for the kernel to wait (Kernel Default 60*HZ) when the backlog_limit is reached before queuing more audit events to be transferred to auditd. The number must be greater than or equal to zero and less that 10 times the default value.

 .B \-i
 Ignore errors when reading rules from a file. This causes auditctl to always return a success exit code.

-.BI \-\-loginuid-immutable
-This option tells the kernel to make loginuids unchangeable once they are set. Changing loginuids requires CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL. So, its not something that can be done by unprivileged users. Setting this makes loginuid tamper-proof, but can cause some problems in certain kinds of containers.

 .BI \-q\  mount-point,subtree
 If you have an existing directory watch and bind or move mount another subtree in the watched subtree, you need to tell the kernel to make the subtree being mounted equivalent to the directory being watched. If the subtree is already mounted at the time the directory watch is issued, the subtree is automatically tagged for watching. Please note the comma separating the two values. Omitting it will cause errors.
